# bronner-time-annotations
This module makes use of the python-wrapper for the java time annotation tool "Heideltime" and enables to work it on a TEI XML file by using the "standoffconverter" library.
It further filters and refines the automated annotations, by use of regex patterns, to fit better for our specific text, which is an early 19th century German travelogue by Franz Xaver Bronner.
